# Description #
This is the mass D2L download tool. Surprise! 
It prompts the user for their username, password (don't worry, we won't steal your sensitive login information), the name of a CSV (for multiple downloads), or OU number (for single downloads), domain (Pathway or BYUI), and the number of concurrent downloads.
The only required field in the csv is OU (all caps is important). The download location is currently set to ../../D2LOriginal. This is located in dlcourse.
